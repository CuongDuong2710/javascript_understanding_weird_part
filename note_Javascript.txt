Section 1. Execution Global

_ Your code is run, because your code is wrapped inside an execution context.

_ Javascript engine creates a Global object 'window' and a special variable called 'this'.

_ window = this

_ variable and function 'not inside function'  -> global

================================
Section 2.

10 - Creation and Hoisting

_ 1st phrase: Execution Context is create (CREATION PHASE).

_ Hoisting: It's not actually moving code to the top of the page.

_ Before your code begins to executed line by line, The Javascript engine has already set aside memory space 
for the variables and all of the function that you've created.

_ When Javascript engine sets up the memory space for 'a', it doesn't know what its value. So instead, it puts a placeholder called 'undefined'.

_ All variables in Javascript are initially set to 'undefined', and functions are sitting in memory in their entirety.

_ Code:

b(); // Called b!
console.log(a); // undefined -> hoisting 

var a = 'Hello World'; // delete this line -> Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined

function b() {
    console.log('Called b!');
}

----------------------------
11 - Javascript and undefined

_ 'undefined': that means the variable hasn't been set. It's actually taking up memory space.

_ Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined -> because that initial execution context creation (creation phase), when it went through it didn't find 'a' var.
So it never set up the memory space.

_ Never set 'a = undefined' -> cannot set anything, only use for debug


----------------------------
13 - Javascript is Single thread, Synchronous execution in its behavior

_ Single thread: one command at a time.

_ Under hood of browser, maybe not.

_ Synchronous: only one thing is happening at a time.

----------------------------
14 - Function invocation and The execution stack

_ b() finishes, because it's at the top of the stack, it will get popped off the stack.
Then a(), then back down to Global Execution Context.

_ Every function is called, a new execution context and 'this  variable is created for that function.
The variables within it are set up during the creation phase. And code is executed line by line.

_ Everytime a function is invoked, even if it's invoking itself, a new execution context is created, put on top of the stack.
When it finished, it popped off the stack.

----------------------------
15 - Function, Context and Variable Environments

_ Variable environment: where the variables live (global object - a window in a browser).

_ myVar declare three times -> they're distince, unique and don't touch each other. Each of these 'myVar' is sitting in its own execution context.

----------------------------
16 - Scope chain

_ Every execution context has a reference to its outer environment.

_ Particular execution context, if it can't find that variable, it will look at the outer reference and go look for variables there.
Depends on where the function sits lexically.

_ Scope: where can I access a variable.

_ Chain: is those links of outer environment references.

_ Lexical: that is where it was physically written in your code.
