Section 1. Execution Global

_ Your code is run, because your code is wrapped inside an execution context.

_ Javascript engine creates a Global object 'window' and a special variable called 'this'.

_ window = this

_ variable and function 'not inside function'  -> global

================================
Section 2. Creation and Hoisting

_ 1st phrase: Execution Context is create (CREATION PHASE).

_ Hoisting: It's not actually moving code to the top of the page.

_ Before your code begins to executed line by line, The Javascript engine has already set aside memory space 
for the variables and all of the function that you've created.

_ When Javascript engine sets up the memory space for 'a', it doesn't know what its value. So instead, it puts a placeholder called 'undefined'.

_ All variables in Javascript are initially set to 'undefined', and functions are sitting in memory in their entirety.

_ Code:

b(); // Called b!
console.log(a); // undefined -> hoisting 

var a = 'Hello World'; // delete this line -> Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined

function b() {
    console.log('Called b!');
}
